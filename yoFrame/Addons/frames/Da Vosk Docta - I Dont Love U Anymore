Da Vosk Docta - I Dont Love U Anymore
Artist: Da Vosk Docta
Album: Deep Purple Roses

i don't love u anymore
since when?
now. just now
i don't wanna lie. can't tell the truth so it's over
doesn't matter. i love you. none of it matters
too late
(paused with a beat)
i don't love u anymore, goodbye

fucked me all night...
i enjoyed it and i came but i prefer you
fucked me, fucked me, fucked me
all night
i enjoyed it
i came
i prefer you
fucked me all night
goodbye
(beat)
fucked me all night
i enjoyed it
fucked me, fucked me, fucked me
all night
(echo in the end)
